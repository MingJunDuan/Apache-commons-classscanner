Commons ClassScanner JSR proposal implementation

This JSR proposal aims to get rid of having tons of different applications
doing their own classpath scanning for annotations over and over
again.

It did not get submitted, but I'm already using the javax.enterprise packge.

DO NOT use this package in production since it is NOT officially specced!
